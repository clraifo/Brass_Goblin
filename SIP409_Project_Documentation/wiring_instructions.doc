Wiring Instructions for the Brass Goblin Project

  Components:

  - Raspberry Pi 4 Model B
  - A4988 Stepper Motor Driver
  - NEMA 17 Stepper Motor
  - Raspberry Pi Camera Module 2
  - Breadboard and Jumper Wires
  - External Power Supply for Stepper Motor (9-12V recommended)
  
  A4988 Stepper Motor Driver Wiring:

    Power Supply to A4988:

  - Connect the motor power supply (9-12V) to the VMOT and GND pins on the A4988.
  - Connect the Raspberry Pi's 5V pin to the VDD pin on the A4988 for logic power.
  - Connect GND from the Raspberry Pi to the GND pin on the A4988 for a common ground.

    Stepper Motor to A4988:

  - Connect one motor coil to the 1A and 1B pins, and the other coil to the 2A and 2B pins on the A4988.
      * The specific wiring order for the coils can be found in the motor's datasheet.

    A4988 to Raspberry Pi GPIO:

  - Connect Raspberry Pi GPIO pin 17 (DIR_PIN) to the DIR pin on the A4988 for direction control.
  - Connect Raspberry Pi GPIO pin 16 (STEP_PIN) to the STEP pin on the A4988 for step control.
  - (Optional) Connect Raspberry Pi GPIO pin 23 (ENABLE_PIN) to the ENABLE pin on the A4988 to toggle the motor's power state.

Raspberry Pi Camera Module 2 Wiring:
  - Insert the camera ribbon cable into the CSI connector on the Raspberry Pi, ensuring proper alignment and secure connection.

Software Setup:

  - Use the 'raspi-config' tool to enable the camera interface.
  - Install the necessary Python libraries (RPi.GPIO, picamera, numpy, Pillow) to interact with the GPIO pins and the camera module.
  - Ensure tflite-runtime is installed for running TensorFlow Lite models.

Final Steps:
  - Double-check all connections before powering on the Raspberry Pi.
  - Run your Python script to start capturing images and controlling the stepper motor based on image classification results.
