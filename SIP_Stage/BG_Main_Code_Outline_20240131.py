'''
This code outlines the primary functional blocks of the Brass Goblin software:

1. Setup and Configuration: Initialization of GPIO, camera, TensorFlow Lite model, and stepper motor.

2. Image Capture: Function to capture an image using the camera when the infrared sensor is triggered.

3. Image Classification: Function to process and classify the image using the TensorFlow Lite model.

4. Case Sorting: Function to actuate the stepper motor based on the classification result.

5. Main Loop: Continuously checks for the sensor trigger, processes the case, and sorts it accordingly.
